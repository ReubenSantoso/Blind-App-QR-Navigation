# Blind-App-QR-Navigation
Abstract:
Visual impairment disabilities are one of many recurring issues that continues to negatively impact the lives of many. Especially due to the of the lack of awareness causing many existing systems, designs, to spaces inaccessible to blind people. Although, many projects aim to tackle the visual disability barrier most fail to succeed in being accessible, scalable, or usable. Therefore, the aim of this project is to propose an app system that ensures an increase in usability through a one touch user experience for blind users, ease of deployment by using technology familiar by the public, finally to increasing accessibility by simplifying access to the app. The proposed apps revolve around QR technology, where one app modifies and generates QR codes with custom instructional data embedded into it. The other a navigational app for blind users to detect and output QR data through auditory cues with a hands-free setup. Furthermore, an exploration of the apps’ features and a live simulation would demonstrate the app’s potential impact and use cases to different contexts enabled through the app’s great flexibility for deployment. Success in the app would hopefully allow huge scale implementation to numerous public areas and shed light on the importance of usability and accessibility of disability apps.
